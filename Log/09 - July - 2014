***Title: Loading Xilinx project

***Log Content: 
Encountered problem when deleting the folder, and replace it with the exact same folder, yet cannot load the project up.
--> Solution is to delete the .metadata folder in the workspace (say in an empty folder), then launch as usual and select file --> import --> General --> existing project into workspace --> select the folder with the original project
--> After that copy any changes made (in src code) to the new folder

Encountered problem with programming FPGA failed --> turn off everything. Restart the computer.

***Title: Ahmed note

***Log Content: 
Reference --> www.warpproject.com --> warpv3
SDK --> Xilinx SDK
Use Ethernet A on the WARP (the outer one)
To program --> Xilinx Tools --> Program FPGA --> Program
Connect UART  --> terra / putty
	--> (For terra only) Change setting by going into setup --> serial port
	--> Baud 115200
	--> 8 bit, none parity, 1 stop bit, now flow control
print --> xil_printf
packet destination is now "a0:a1:a2:a3:a4:a5"

mac_high functions
	receive from ethernet and send to wifi callback --> eth_pkt_transmit
		see wlan_poll_eth
	send from wifi to ethernet callback --> mac_high eth_pkt_send (doesn't work though)
		see wlan_mac_high_process_ipc_msg

anti-virus has to be off when compile
clean may help if not compile

***Title: Compiling the reference design

***Log Content: 
Each reference design has its own compatible xilinx SDK version. Current Xilinx SDK 14.4 Build SDK_P.49d works with release 0.71. Xilinx SDK would not be able to compile v0.9 reference design.
The UART doesn't work. Tried with Putty & tera term @ 115200 8bit none parity, 1 stop bit & No flow control

***Title: Fixed UART no output when program FPGA

***Log Content: 
Fixed UART no output when program FPGA:
- The issue was that the system.bit file used contained no software information. Therefore programming FPGA with system.bit will not boot up any software.
- Solution is to compile project and then program FPGA with system.bit file as below:
Do not leave the "ELF file to Initialize in Block RAM" as bootloop. The board will not be booted.
	--> When program FPGA to set the "ELF file to Initialize in Block RAM" in Software Configuration to the appropriate .elf files (which are automatically generated by the SDK if project compiles successfully).
	--> wlan_mac_high_ap.elf and wlan_mac_low_dcf.elf

***Title: Able to receive packets from wifi

***Log Content: 
By changing the hostapd mac address to be the same as the WARP ethernet A mac address (40:d8:55:40:22:84), the board was able to receive packets directed to the hostapd from stations (tested with phone).
Implemented forwarding packet from WARP to PC via ethernet with WARP header (default 0 1 1 2).
Problem encountered: there was no reply from host apd (probe request from phone is incorrect?)

***Title: RadioTap header

***Log Content: 
Excluding the WARP header, WARP will send the Dot11 frame without the RadioTap. The scapy program has to insert an appropriate RadioTap and then forward to the hostapd. Still researching on the "appropriate" radio tap to append in front since each management packet seems to have a different radio tap

***Title: Useful wireshark filters

***Log Content: 
To filter MAC address of wireless packets:
wlan.sa = ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff --> source address
wlan.da = ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff --> destination address

To filter type:
wlan.fc.type = 0 (mangement for example)
wlan.fc.type_subtype = 8 (beacon for example)

***Title: Added retry parameter in WARP header

***Log Content: 
Added an extra byte (5th byte) in WARP header to specify the retry that the WARP should attempt in transmitting the ethernet packet received from PC engine.
The retry number currently depends on the type of messages that the PC Engine wants to transmit:
    Broadcast --> 0 times retry
    unicast --> 7 times retry (this includes management frames and data frames)
